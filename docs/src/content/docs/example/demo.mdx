import GameHostIFrame from '../../../components/iframe/GameHost.astro';
import GameClientIFrame from '../../../components/iframe/GameClient.astro';

A demonstration of the Echo-D usage.
It makes use of iframes to simulate multiple clients,
and uses `BroadcasChannel` to communicate between them.
The host and clients are all running in the same page,
but in a real-world scenario, the host and clients would
be running in separate windows or tabs.

Click on one of the client windows to give it focus, then use arrow keys to move client positions.
Or click on the buttons below to update the clients.
The escape key will clear the logs for the active frame.

### Host

<GameHostIFrame />

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start; align-items: flex-start; width: 100%;">
    <div style="margin-top: 0; width: 50%;">
        ### Client 1
        
        <GameClientIFrame />
    </div>

    <div style="margin-top: 0; width: 50%;">
        ### Client 2
        <GameClientIFrame />
    </div>
</div>

#### Add a client

You can add a new client window by clicking the button below.
This will open a new window with a client running in it.
Buttons are not available in the client windows, instead use the arrow keys.

<br/>
<a style="cursor: pointer;" onClick="window.open('/client', 'New Client', 'height=200,width=200');">
    Open a new client window.
</a>
