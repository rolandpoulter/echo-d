description: High level example of the Echo-D usage.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This example is split into two parts, the `./host.js` and the `./client.js`.
However it is possible to use **Echo-D** in other network topologies.
It is important to prevent the flow of data from the various nodes to not cycle
around or else it will create an infinite loop.
To prevent this, it is recommended to use the `mask` option in the `updater` method
as well as the other options in the `EchoD` constructor.

## Events

<Tabs><TabItem label="Node.js Supported">
Uses `EventEmitter` from `node:events` to create an `events` object.
This can be bundled for use in browsers with a bundler such as
`esbuild`, `webpack`, `bun build`, or another bundler.

```js
// events.js
import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
export const events = new EventEmitter( );
```
</TabItem><TabItem label="Browser">
Here is an example of barebones `events` implementation.
It is recommended to use a library such as `mitt` for handling events.
However this illustrates that **Echo-D** only uses `on` and `emit` methods.

```js
// events.js
export const events = { evo: { },
    on( ev, cb ) {
        if ( Array.isArray( this.evo[ ev ] ) )
            this.evo[ ev ].push( cb );
        else this.evo[ ev ] = [ cb ];
    },
    emit( ev, ...data ) {
        if ( Array.isArray( this.evo[ ev ] ) )
            for ( const cb of this.evo[ ev ] )
                cb.call( this, ...data );
    }
};
```
</TabItem></Tabs>
